# IronHack Project | Canvas Game

# R U N

## Description

R U N is a game where the player has to move a ball from left to right in order to stop it from reaching the top of the screen, once this happens the game will end. The longer the player manages to keep the ball away from the ceiling, the higher the score will be.

## Backlog

- Add diagonal tiles.
- Add jumping mechanic for the ball.
- Increase speed of the upwards motion of the tiles as the game progresses.
